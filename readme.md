# Publications

### It's just a sample of use **Resilience4j** as circuit breaker.

Run this project using instances of **Wiremock**, **Redis** and **Mongo**, I used docker-compose to run this instances.

The docker-compose.yml that I used are in root folder of this project.

#### PS:
After run the project and sent same publication you need entry into wiremock container create a copy of file comments.json at /home/wiremock/mappings/comments.json and then change comment URL with id of publication on mongodb.
